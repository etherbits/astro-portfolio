title: Professional Beginnings
content:
  In 2021, I delved into freelancing, familiarizing myself with client collaboration.
  Later, from 2022 to 2023, an exciting Unilab internship introduced me to a modern work environment.
  Working closely in small teams, we developed websites for Ilia State University.
  This endeavor greatly honed my collaborative skills.
