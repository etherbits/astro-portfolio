description: E-Base is a web application for managing TV shows and movies,
  conceived as my final project for Harvard University's CS50 course.
  The application retrieves data from The Movie Database (TMDB)
  and enables users to curate their own media list linked to their account.
  As the sole developer, I assumed responsibility for both the front-end
  and back-end development of this project.
