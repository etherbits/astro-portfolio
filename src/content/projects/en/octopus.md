description: Octopus is a desktop application designed to streamline
  music organization and playback. It leverages the cross-platform capabilities
  of web technologies for the front-end interface,
  complemented by Rust on the back-end for seamless OS communication.
  Octopus integrates with a Jellyfin server,
  a Software Media System enabling users to host and manage their content,
  to retrieve metadata, and access audio streams. As the sole developer,
  I am working on its ongoing development.
