description: Sandro's Books is a website dedicated to showcasing audiobooks authored 
    by UniLab's director, Sandro Asatiani. The catalog features a diverse range of topics, 
    with an integrated audio player that offers all the standard user functionalities.
    My colleague, Mindia Arabuli, and I were responsible for modernizing the existing 
    codebase into a React Single Page Application (SPA). We also introduced new features, 
    including playback capabilities and dynamic routing. Throughout this process,
    we worked closely with the UI/UX design team to bring the envisioned product to life.
