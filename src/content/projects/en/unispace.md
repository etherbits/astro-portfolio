description: "UniSpace is a dedicated platform designed for both lecturers and students of UniLab, an accelerated program affiliated with Ilia State University. This platform empowers lecturers with course and participant management capabilities, while also granting students the convenience of accessing course information and enrolling. Along with a fellow developer, Mindia Arabuli, I was entrusted with crafting the front-end of the website, adhering closely to the finalized UI/UX designs provided by our design team. Additionally, we maintained open communication with our back-end development counterparts to ensure seamless API compatibility."
